# research-demo
we are working on a demo that contains an RDF graph using rdflib library in Python, defining a set of entities related to energy, such as time, location, energy source, and more. The graph is serialized into both Turtle and JSON-LD formats, and then displayed on a web page using Leaflet.js, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. The map displays the locations defined in the RDF graph, showing their latitude and longitude coordinates. The code demonstrates how RDF graphs can be used to represent data, and how they can be visualized on the web using various libraries and tools.
